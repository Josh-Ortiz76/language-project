                             Final Project

"What small problems do you need to solve"
    -We need to figure out how to map a trigram to its appropriate element.
    -Figure out how to incorporate the similarity formula into our project.
    -Compile script

"How will you solve them?"
    -We will start by researching the problems in order to get a better grasp as
      what we need to be doing. If that does not help us entirely understand how
      to solve our issues, then taking these issues up with the course staff
      would be our next step. Then, using their feedback, we will make the
      appropriate adjustments.

"What classes, if any, will you create or subclass?"
    -If we do end up creating a class, it will be a language class


"What files will you need to create?"
    -We would need a Query file and a language file to identify the language and compare it with the query.

"For Milestone 1, how will your main() be structured?"
  - It will take a command line argument and compute the trigram frequency.

"For Milestone 2, how will your main() be structured?"
  -Takes the multiple files and based on the trigram frequency, determines What
    language is closest in relation to it.

"What libraries will you need?"
    -We will need:
        -#include <iostream>; //to read the files
        -#include <vector>; //to store the trigrams
        -#include <string>; //to work with the contents of the files
        -#include <fstream>; //to gather the contents in the files
        -If we make our own class, (which we might have to) we will make sure
          to include that as well.

"What files will your compile script have to compile?"
    -Would just have to compile the language.cpp and the main.cpp.
